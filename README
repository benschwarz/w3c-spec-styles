So, I've been trying to read specs more than ever. 
Not only is the language used some form of incomprehensible bullshit, but the readability to these pages is absysmal. 

I've been considering this for a few months now.

Why does a page have to look like (see screen shot attachment) that ugly ass bullshit? 
I think the pages could easily hide some useless information and present a little easier to read - (see other screen shot) 

What do you think? Interested at applying some typography to the specs with me? I'm planning on writing an article about it and sending it to the whatwg and w3c mailing lists...
